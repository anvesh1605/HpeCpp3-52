AOS-CX 4100i Release Notes

Table of contents

# Upgrade information

When upgrading the switch to major versions, the switch may require an upgrade for SVOS or ISP. In such cases, the switch will take additional time, delaying the overall upgrade time. Consequently, when performing a VSX upgrade, there is a delay to complete one VSX pair.

NOTE

If a switch has RPVST enabled and the native VLAN ID configured for a trunk interface is not the default VLAN ID 1, and the native VLAN ID is also used as the management VLAN, the switch may not be accessible over the trunk interface after upgrading from any 10.04.00xx version of software.

To fix the issue after an upgrade, log into the switch using the OOBM interface or serial port console and configure the following:

```
Copy

switch# configure
switch(config)# spanning-tree rpvst-mstp-interconnect-vlan <VLAN_ID>
```

where <VLAN\_ID> is the native VLAN ID configured on the trunk interface.

If there are multiple trunk interfaces configured on the switch, each with a different VLAN ID, contact the Aruba Support Team.

NOTE

Do not interrupt power to the switch during this important update.
